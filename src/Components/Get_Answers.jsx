                    <span className="underline"><em>Things Fall Apart </em></span> by Chinua Achebe is a powerful novel that explores the impact of colonialism on Igbo society in Nigeria. While the book primarily focuses on the cultural clash between traditional Igbo values and the forces of European colonization, elements of socialism can be observed throughout the narrative.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In <span className="underline"><em>Things Fall Apart </em></span>, socialism is intricately woven into the fabric of Igbo society. The communal living, shared values, and collective decision-making processes within the Igbo community reflect socialist ideals of cooperation, mutual support, and a sense of common ownership. The emphasis on communal well-being over individual success is a key aspect of socialism that is portrayed in the novel. <br />
                    Furthermore, the Igbo system of governance, which includes village councils and democratic decision-making processes, can be seen as a form of grassroots socialism where power is distributed among the community members rather than concentrated in the hands of a few. The egalitarian nature of Igbo society, where social status is earned through hard work and merit rather than inherited wealth or privilege, aligns with socialist principles of equality and social justice. <br />
                    However, the intrusion of British colonialism disrupts the socialist structures within Igbo society. The imposition of Western economic systems, legal frameworks, and religious beliefs leads to the erosion of traditional socialistic values and practices. The introduction of a capitalist economy based on monetary wealth, individual land ownership, and hierarchical power structures undermines the communal way of life that existed in pre-colonial Igbo society.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In conclusion, <span className="underline"><em>Things Fall Apart </em></span> by Chinua Achebe offers a poignant exploration of socialism within the context of traditional Igbo society and its encounter with European colonialism. The novel highlights the strengths and vulnerabilities of socialist ideals in the face of external influences, shedding light on the complexities of social, cultural, and political dynamics in a rapidly changing world.

                    üåø Expressive realism, in critical theory, is the idea that cultural texts (like literature and art) realistically depict the world while also expressing individual and collective experiences and emotions. It highlights how these texts reflect and shape social realities, influenced by and influencing the socio-political context.

                    In summary, expressive realism and common sense theory are connected through their focus on how cultural texts reflect, shape, and influence everyday beliefs and social norms. Both examine the interplay between individual experiences and broader societal forces, highlighting the role of culture in constructing and challenging common sense.

                      Janie is described as a beautiful woman with long, flowing hair that symbolizes her independence and strength. Raised by her grandmother, Nanny, after her mother{"'"}s abandonment, Janie{"'"}s early life is marked by Nanny{"'"}s protective and somewhat restrictive guidance, aiming to secure Janie a stable future.

                      A crucial aspect of Janie{"'"}s character is her evolving voice and identity.

Over time, Janie finds her voice, particularly after Jody{"'"}s death, and begins to assert her own needs and desires. Her relationship with Tea Cake allows her to express herself more freely and explore her own identity.
